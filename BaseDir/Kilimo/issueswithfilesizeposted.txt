server return "undefined" when we tried to post the data of more that 1mb i think if you tried this 
in admin panel you will get the file size error, so i think this error related to size of content we 
posted in backend since by default its set to not exceed 1mb, i tried to post the small size < 1mb content
with 2 images and everything is good. I THINK THIS IS ERROR WE SHOULD KNOW
